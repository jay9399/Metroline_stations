# Metroline_stations
Metroline is a C++ project designed to find the optimal route between stations in a metro network using Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm is well-known for efficiently determining the shortest path in a graph, making it an ideal choice for navigating metro systems.



Future Goals
Enhanced User Authentication:

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to the login process by requiring a second form of identification.
OAuth Integration: Allowing users to log in using their existing social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Real-Time Data Integration:

Live Updates: Incorporate real-time data on train schedules, delays, and service changes to provide the most accurate routing information.
Traffic Analysis: Use historical data to predict and avoid congested routes.
Mobile Application:

Cross-Platform Support: Develop a mobile application for both Android and iOS to provide users with route information on the go.
Push Notifications: Send real-time alerts and updates directly to users' devices.
Advanced Routing Algorithms:

Multi-Criteria Optimization: Extend the algorithm to consider multiple factors such as cost, time, and convenience when suggesting routes.
Alternative Routes: Provide users with multiple route options to choose from based on different criteria.
User Personalization:

Profile Management: Allow users to save favorite routes, frequently visited stations, and travel preferences.
Personalized Recommendations: Suggest routes and services based on user behavior and preferences.
Community Features:

Feedback and Reviews: Enable users to leave feedback on stations and routes to help improve the system.
Crowdsourced Updates: Allow users to report issues or changes in real-time, enhancing the accuracy of the data.
